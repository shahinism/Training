Training
========
A repository to collect all my code training in one place.

Challenges are mostly coming from [project euler][http://projecteuler.net/] (using [EulerPy][https://github.com/iKevinY/EulerPy]), [Nodeschool][http://nodeschool.io/], [Codewars][http://codewars.com].

I also try to explain interesting challenges in my blog [Shahinism][http://shahinism.github.io] (in Persian).
